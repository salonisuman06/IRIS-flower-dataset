# IRIS-flower-dataset
The Iris Dataset includes 50 samples of three different iris species with measurements for four characteristics (sepal and petal length and breadth) (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). A linear discriminant model was developed using these metrics to categorise the species.
